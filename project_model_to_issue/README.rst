and automatically link it to the initial object via a reference field.

To use this module, you need to:

* go to a model or object in tree or form view (ie Partner ou Product).
* select a record (if your are in tree view).
* select 'Create a related issue' in the 'More' button.
* the task and its 'Task Origin' field is set: complete and save the task form.
